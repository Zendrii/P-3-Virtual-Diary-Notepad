# P-3 Virtual Diary/Notepad
A program that records the lines/words you give it and puts it in a text file
## How it Works
This program asks the user for an input which in turn, appends it to the text file in the same folder, and asks if you want to add more. If you choose to add more, the program starts all over again and if you choose otherwise, the program ends.
## How to Use
When you see the `Entry: ` prompt, you type the line/words that you want to add. After that, you will see the `Do you want to add more? (y/n) ` prompt. If you choose `y`, the program will start all over again. If you choose `n`, the program will stop.
